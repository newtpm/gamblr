George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950; Irish playwright and co-founder of the London School of Economics) I was watching TV one day when a Virginia Lottery advertisement for their new game Keno was shown. This got me to wondering how fair (or perhaps rigged the game was so I dedcided to find out by simulating a single Keno game, many times. The results were surprising and I decided I would expand it to beyond Keno.

If you were offered a $2 payout for correctly guessing Heads or Tails on a $1 bet, you could intuitively deduce that a single bet would result in the binary outcome of you having either gained or lost $1. Further, you could mentally extrapolate to see that the more often this bet is made, the more likely you are to end up at breakeven. Nothing to clever here, if we didnt encounter this is a statistics class, we certainly learned it over years of experience. Now, what if for that $1 bet the payout was $5 for getting it correct? Its easy to mentally determine that we would want to play this game as often as possible. But what if the payout was only $1.90? This is certainly a lot less attractive a bet and most people would elect not to play. However, this house edge of 10% is on the low end of what most games offer. What makes the game more appealing would be the possibility of a large payout. Lets change the payout to be $1.90 for a correct result, but if you are correct 10 times in a row, there is a further $750 payout. Now it is not so clear whether this bet should be accepted, and requires some probability calculations to determine whether it is a good or bad bet. Nevertheless, $750 sounds like a large amount and it is this possibility of a large payout that encourages people to accept the bet. Whether this improved incentive makes it a worthy bet will be shown later. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 4.1: Here is a nice figure!
